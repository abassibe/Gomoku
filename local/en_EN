BasicRuleTitle=Basic rule:
BasicRuleText=Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. Black plays first. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
CaptureRule=Capture rule:
CaptureRuleText1=Captures are made by flanking a pair of the opponent’s stones, as demonstrated below:
CaptureRuleText2=In this scenario, White capture the Black pair and removes the stones from the game. The now-free intersections can be played on as if they were never occupied.\nOne can only capture PAIRS, not single stones, and not more than 2 stones in a row.\n\nAlso note that one can not move into a capture. Example :
CaptureRuleText3=In this scenario, Black can play between White without losing the pair.\nHowever, if later Black takes one of the White stones, his position becomes vulnerable to capture...\n\nThis rule adds a win condition : If you manage to capture ten of your opponent’s stones, you win the game.
GameEndingRule=Game-Ending capture rule:
GameEndingCaptureRuleText1=A player that manages to align five stones only wins if the opponent can not break this alignment by capturing a pair, or if he has already lost four pairs and the opponent can capture one more, therefore winning by capture.\nThere is no need for the game to go on if there is no possibility of this happening.
DoubleThreeRule=Double Three rule:
DoubleThreeRuleText1=It is forbidden to play a move that introduces two free-threealignments, which would guarantee a win by alignment.\n\nA free-three is an alignement of three stones that, if not immediately blocked, allows for an indefendable alignment of four stones (that’s to say an alignment of four stones with two unobstructed extremities).\n\nThese scenarios are free-threes, valid in any direction (diagonal, vertical and horizontal):
DoubleThreeRuleText2=A double-three is a move that introduces two simultaneous free-three alignments. This is an indefendable scenario.
